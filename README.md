> Flash3D is a scalable 3D point cloud transformer backbone built for top speed and minimal memory cost by targeting modern GPU architectures.

## üì∞ News
- **(04/02/2025)**: Upgraded to ThunderKittens 2.

## üöÄ Installation
Flash3D requires newer versions of **CUDA >= 12.4**, **gcc >= 12**, **PyTorch >= 2.4**, and **[TransformerEngine](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/transformer-engine/user-guide/index.html)**. Earlier versions might work but have not been tested.

### Docker Workflow
We recommend using our provided Docker environment for fast development. Please refer to the [doc/build_docker.md](doc/build_docker.md) for instructions.

### Quick Install
If you prefer to set up the environment from scratch, you can install the package as follows:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone --recursive https://github.com/liyanc/Flash3DTransformer.git Flash3D
cd Flash3D

# Declare target GPU architecture (e.g., SM80 for A100, SM89 for L4, SM90a for H100)
export F3D_CUDA_ARCH=89

# Install Flash3D
python setup.py install
```

## üß™ Unit Tests
Flash3D includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests in the `test/` directory to ensure functional correctness and facilitate CI/CD.
Many tests utilize the KITTI dataset, which requires configuring the path to its root directory prior to execution. 
For detailed setup and run instructions, please refer to the documentation in [doc/unit_tests.md](doc/unit_tests.md).

You can run all tests with two commands:
```bash
export KITTI_RT={You KITTI dataset root}
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## ‚ö° Running Flash3D
Below is a minimal example of how to run Flash3D on a batch of sample 3D point clouds:

```python
import torch
from flash3dxfmr.layers import Flash3D

# Generate or load your configuration
config = ...

# Initialize the Flash3D model
f3d_xfmr = Flash3D(config)

# Load input data and process it with Flash3D
input_pcd, input_feat, batch_sep = ...
output_feats = f3d_xfmr(input_pcd, input_feat, batch_sep)

# Your results
print(output_feats.shape)
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
Here are some of our future development goals:
- [ ] Automate CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Attach CI/CD with PyPA for `pip install`
- [ ] Native fusion with FlashAttention-3 and beyond for best Hopper and Blackwell(ThorU) support.
- [ ] Add multi-architecture compilation for Ampere, Ada, Hopper, and Thor in one package
- [ ] Push pre-trained NuScenes models
- [ ] Include more flexible position encoding modules
